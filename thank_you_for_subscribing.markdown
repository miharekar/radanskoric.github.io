I’ve got your address but I’m not allowed to send you stuff until you click the link in the welcome email.

**Check your email** and **click the link** to confirm your email address please.

You will be missing out otherwise. This happens _a lot!_

Sorry this is a pain but it is **one time only**.

Then we’re all set.
