I am a senior full stack developer with team leading experience.
Currently I primarily work with Ruby and its ecosystem.
In my current job I split my time between coding the backend
of a very complex application and leading, motivating and
increasing efficiency of a team of developers.

I value simple over complex solutions and I put a lot of emphasis
on quality in all aspects of product development,
especially in times of great pressure. As a team lead I subscribe
to the "serving lead" philosophy by giving people a clear goal
and then helping them do the best work possible and improve along
the way.
