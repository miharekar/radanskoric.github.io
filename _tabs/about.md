I am a senior full stack developer with over 15 years of professional experience
solving problems with Software and leading teams of developers.
I primarily work with Ruby and its ecosystem although recently I
have started developing a taste for Rust on the side.
For most of my career I have split my time between coding the backend
of (mostly complex) applications and leading, motivating and
increasing efficiency of a team of developers.

I value simple over complex solutions and I put a lot of emphasis
on quality in all aspects of product development,
especially in times of great pressure. As a team lead I subscribe
to the "serving lead" philosophy by giving people a clear goal
and then helping them do the best work possible and improve along
the way.

I have a passion for elegant and easy to understand code and for
having a deep understanding of how the system and libraries I am using work.
I try to reflect this in my writing.
